Go to your `vite.config.js` file and add the following:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"
import { r3f } from "@react-three/editor/vite"

export default defineConfig((env) => ({
  plugins: [env.command === 'build' ? react() : r3f()],
}))
```

And voila!

You should have an editor in your app that writes changes back into your code.

Run 
```bash
npm run dev
```

and open `localhost:5173` to play with your scene.

You don't have to change anything in your scene, it will just work.

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls, Sphere } from '@react-three/drei'

export const App = () => (
  <Canvas camera={{ fov: 45, position: [-4, 2, -4] }}>
    <Sparkles position={[1, 1, 1]} />
    <OrbitControls makeDefault />
    <mesh position={[6.948, -2.158, 0.465]}>
      <boxBufferGeometry attach="geometry" />
      <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color="red" />
    </mesh>
    <directionalLight position={[4.224, 1.912, 3.046]} />
    <ambientLight />
    <Sphere position={[8.817, 1.557, 5.818]} />
  </Canvas>
)
```

By default, the editor will add some recongnized native elements, and React components that have transform-related props, eg. `position`, `rotation`, `scale` or a `name` prop. This way we can avoid the noise of having to show the whole React component tree (You have the devtools for that..).

Please provide feedback about your experience. We are trying to learn what will be helpful.
